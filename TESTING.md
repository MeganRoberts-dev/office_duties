# Testing

## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| templates | register.html | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/validation/html-register.png) | |

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

### Python

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Site |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/features/login-page.png) | Works as expected |

| Edge | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/browsers/edge.png) | Works as expected |
| Opera | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/browsers/opera.png) | Works as expected |

## Responsiveness

I've tested my deployed project on multiple devices to check for responsiveness issues.

| Device | Login | Register | Home | Add Duty | Notes |

| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/login-response-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/resgister-response-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/home-response-mobile.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/add-duty-response-mobile.png) | Works as expected |
| Tablet (DevTools) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/tablet-login-response.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/register-tablet-response.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/tablet-home-response.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/responsivness/tablet-add-duty-response.png) | Works as expected |

## Lighthouse Audit

I've tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues.

| Page | Mobile | Desktop | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Login | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/lighthouse/mobile-login.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/lighthouse/desktop-login.png) | No warnings |
| Add Duty| ![screenshot](/static/documentation/lighthouse/add-duty.png) | ![screenshot](/static/documentation/lighthouse/add-duty-desktop.png) | No warnings |

> [!NOTE]  
> Due to login and security credentials, I am unable to perform a Lighthouse audit on the home page directly; however, based on the successful results from auditing the login and add duty pages, I can reasonably assume that the home page would also meet the same performance and accessibility standards.

## Defensive Programming

ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘ğŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

## Bugs

- Aria-describedby tag bug

    ![screenshot](/static/documentation/bugs/bug-1.png)

    - To fix this, I add aria-describedby="usernameHelp". This ensures that the input field points to an element that provides additional information about the input..

- Unnecessary backrground-attachmeent tag.


    ![screenshot](/static/documentation/bugs/bug-2.png)

    - To fix this, I removed the backrgound-attachment fixed line.

- Conflicting bootstrap code.

    ![screenshot](/static/documentation/bugs/bug-3.png)

    - To fix this, I named the container a different class name, this way I could edit the ccs wwithout it conflicting with boostrap syntax. 

- Python not checking username.

    ![screenshot](/static/documentation/bugs/bug-4.png)

    - To fix this, I enusred the code was retrieving and comparing the session["user"] value with the correct field (e.g., "username") from the database, using session.get("user") == owner["username"] for a proper comparison..
